# Design Plan

The new design is inspired by a simple flowing one or two column layout. The header images and navigation are compressed into one, to create a simple navigation structure and subtle branding. The color palette is a mix of green and blue to hint at the renewable energy research. This site design was greatly inspired by [Beats by Dre](https://www.beatsbydre.com) site. One of the best features of the site is the images in the collapsible navigation, that I hope to replicate on the in this redesign.


## Color Palette

The headers should use the whimiscal curvy font Work Sans. While the body text is a more conventional sans-serif Montserrat that is easy to read. Both of these are google fonts that can be found at (https://fonts.google.com/)
